 ApplePicker, Mission Demolition and Prototype 1

# Prototype1
I took elements from all the projects we have made so far
Ex: rollaball - Ball/scripts Movement, ApplePicker - Triggers Camera, Mission Demolition - Clouds Castle Goal

My goal for my prototype was to make a 2D platformer that was meant to be more difficult, for example I included jumps that would restart you if missed. I also included an end if the player makes it. I wanted to add more element to lock the ending but I couldn't get it to work.
